  <p>
     or CCD is one of the biggest ecological disasters our planet is facing. Since 2006, countries around the world have reported a loss of approximately 45-50% in honey bee populations. Last year, beekeepers in the U.S. lost 50% of their colonies, on average. When one considers the amount of crops that are almost entirely dependent on pollinators, the scope of the problem becomes clear. Without honey bees, almonds wouldnt exist!

  <span class="jump-in"> What is swarming?</span>
  <p>
     Swarming is a natural survival habit of the bee. It typically occurs during the spring, when a colony has reached a large enough size that it decides to split its population and find a new hive. Although alarming to the onlooker- during this process (and in general) the bees are very docile and easy to handle. Since humans began domesticating bees, this behavior has been used as a critical resource for replenishing beekeeper's colonies. As the bee population plummets, it is now critical for beekeepers to be able to react quickly and capture swarms for preservation.

  <span class="jump-in"> Why does this matter?</span>
  <p>
    It matters because the honey bee is in desperate need of our help. Most people don't realize that these little ladies are directly responsible for continued existence of crops we love and enjoy every day, including: blueberries, cherries, melons, and broccoli. We need them as much as they need us!
  </p>

  <span class="jump-in"> What can I do?</span>
  <p>
    There are a ton of ways you can personally help, and no- you do not have to be a beekeeper. The major way you can directly help is to simply assist beekeepers in finding wild swarms! Thats where we come in. You can use the 'I found bees!' button to report a swarm location, and any information you feel is relevant.
